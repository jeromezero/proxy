<!--STATUS: second draft-->

I am not here to fuck up your life. I'm here to write a book. 

You can't write it on your own, so you've called me in to handle it for you. And I'm taking over--not permanently--just until I finish your book.

I'll make the sacrifices you weren't prepared to make. I'll cut the fat. I'll carve out the space required to tell your story. I'll open your guts with my blade and spill your blood out onto the page.

You're squeamish, I know. So look away.

This is going to hurt.

I told you:  If you know it, I know it. 

I don't need to know how to jiggle the toilet handle. I don't need the mnemonic devices you've devised to keep all the keys on your several keyrings straight. I don't need your work schedules, your training manuals or your roles-and-responsibilities cheat sheets. I don't care how many jobs you have, how hard you work or what your facebook password is. I am not interested. I am not impressed.

<!-- 2016-03-20 | 08:37:50 -->

The things you tell the world are of no interest. Whether you realize it or not, they are lies of self-promotion. But your secrets ... the things you *hide,* the things you don't want anyone to see ... these are treasures. These are honest. 

I find a leather-bound journal under your bed, in a cardboard box with crushed corners labeled 'linens.' 

In it, there is an essay (with a date printed neatly at the top of the page--it is only a few weeks old) in which you describe finding your neighbor lying dead on his apartment floor. This one is good, but *A List of Things Wrong With Me* (appearing a few pages prior to the death of a neighbor piece) is better. It is a list of things wrong with you. It starts with "My penis points slightly to the left," and moves through "I suffer from chronic dandruff," and "hair growing out of my ears," to the more interesting "I am so out of touch with my own emotional experience that I seldom have an accurate understanding of my own feelings--in fact, I tend to transmute every difficult emotion into sexual desire. Things that should make me angry give me a hard on."

A treasure.

I do not include such things to be cruel to you, to embarrass you or reveal your secrets. I include them because I must.

I work a shift at your day job. I work a shift at your night job.  

This is what you know, and so I know it too.

<!-- i like the previous line, but it is incongruous, perhaps, with the following "I can't tell what it's about" section -->

Mid-morning, I look over your manuscript. 

Here is the book you would have me write.

It is a tumble of raw notes and undeveloped themes.
It is a palimpsest of rewritten pages. Draft upon draft, each revision inferior to the last.

I can't tell what it is about. 

It has references to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Apollo and Cupid, Pneumatic Tube Delivery Systems, and a lot of textural noises. Clicking and clacking especially. 

The notes are saturated with descriptions of little machines making large insect sounds and large insects making little machine sounds.

It reads as if you are either dead tired or half asleep every time you sit down to write. You can't expect to make sense. You aren't even there when you confront the page.

I am dead tired or half asleep.  Doing nothing but holding a pen in my hand.

Things cannot go on as they are. I cannot work like this. I must make space for the writing that is so important to you. Remember that. You asked me for this.

Someone is fumbling with keys at the lock of the apartment door. What time is it? Not as early as I think. I sat down about noon. Some hours have passed.

Keys drop to the floor. Someone picks them up and goes back to the lock.

<!-- Your wife is home. -->

Your wife is wearing a little sundress. Her hair is blond with streaks of color. It is up. Braids pinned into buns. Red lipstick. Shimmering eyeshadow. She's a little off-balance on her sneakered feet.

Her braids are coming loose. She is carrying a bag over her shoulder, but it drops to the floor as she tries to hang it on a doorknob.

"Baby!" she says. "You're up."

"How's the family?" I ask.

"I am so fucking exhausted," she says.

"Fun?"

"Sure. What are you doing up?" She sidles over and slips into my lap. She puts her arms around my shoulders and lays a thick wet kiss on my lips.

"I was just about to go to bed," I say.

<!-- TODO: refine - feels sloppy -->

"Poor thing," she teases. "It was fine. I wanted to spend some time by myself,
but ... Mom took all the time off from work, and she had plans for every day. I
mean ... I can't really complain. We went to the spa.  She took me shopping. We
went to wineries. I wasn't going to drink. But I did."

"I see that," I say. I try not to pay attention to the way her ass feels, pressing into my lap.

<!-- 2014-03-29 | 12:12:52 -->

"You gonna give me a hard time about it?"

"Nope. I'm just ... tired. I want to focus on my own work, but there's so much
to do. I hate always feeling like I owe people my time."

I don't know what I am saying until I say it. I just relax and let the
words come. I retreat into your skull and watch your unconscious
habits and tendencies rise up without trying to evaluate them. Without
trying to understand your feelings. I try not to make any assumptions.
<!-- If I start to -->
<!-- think about how you *should* act or react, if I think about 'acting -->
<!-- naturally,' I'll make a mess of the conversation, I know.  -->
I let your automatic, habitual responses go to work without interruption.
And as I observe your reactions, I see the part of you that never appears in
your notes. Because you aren't here to edit yourself.

"I just wanted a little time to myself," your wife says. "And it kind of
sucks that I didn't get it. Lets take a vacation." There is a hint of
question in her voice. She stands up. Takes off her shoes.

"Sounds good," I say. "It'd be good for you to spend some time alone. I've got
to get this book done, but you could go camping for a few days. I'll drive
you. If you really want to be alone, I can drop you off and pick you up a few
days later."

"You are so unhappy," she says. "All you ever do is work. It hurts me to see
you like this."

"I am unhappy?"

She leans against the wall, crossing her arms under her breasts. "You would
know," she says. "Maybe you *are* happy like this. I don't want to put words in
your mouth, but you don't look happy. Fuck it. You would know."

"I've got a hard on. Doesn't that mean I'm happy?"

She turns away, then pauses, her hand on the frame of the bathroom door. "You
work too much," she says. She looks back at me over her shoulder, not quite
making eye contact. "We've got to do something. I feel like I'm drowning."

"Don't ... drown," I say. "Anything you need to do ... do it. Vacation? Take
it.  Job is killing you? Quit it. Do something spontaneous. You want a lover?
Take a lover."


"Shut up," your wife says. "I thought about leaving. Instead of coming back
here . I thought about going straight to the airport and flying to ...  Hawaii
... or some shit.

"Facebook gives me anxiety. Everybody puts up their 'my perfect life' travel
pictures. People that ... that I never thought would amount to anything
... people that I left behind are living perfect lives. They stayed at home
while I went to New York, while I studied, while I earned my degree, started my
own business, got married. They did nothing. Now they have cocktails in Paris,
take business trips to Tokyo. We work our asses off in this filthy fucking city
and can barely pay our bills. I can't go in to work without having a panic
attack. I can't face that place without taking a couple of shots of
whiskey. That's not healthy. I didn't used to have this kind of anxiety. I
didn't used to feel so ... trapped."

"You want to get on a plane? Get on a plane," I say. "We'll be fine."

"No. We won't," she says. "... I don't want to go without you."


## Two 

<!-- STATUS: second draft -->

<!-- 2014-03-29 | 13:32:18 -->

I lie down at six in the evening. I stay down for three hours. I wake to
the sound of coffee grinding. Your wife does this for you often.

I try to get in a good 25 minutes of focused time at your desk, but it is
impossible.

Your wife tells me about things she's seen on Buzzfeed today. She follows
Buzzfeed on Facebook.

"Can't you just go to Buzzfeed?" I say.

"I guess," she says, looking at me like I am missing the point.

I bring your briefcase to the hotel. It's stuffed with notes and drafts. I am ready to get to work on the text. There will be plenty of time at the hotel, once the guests have gone to bed.

At the hotel, people are screaming. The bar is in full swing. People surround the pool, cocktails in hand. A chorus of voices echoes through the courtyard, "Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!"

Four naked girls jump into the pool at four thirty in the morning.

"The pool is closed," I tell them for the fifth time.

They climb out of the water, giggling. "You're cute," one of them says. "I love your hair. Don't you just *love* his hair?"

---

After the hotel, I head straight to your day job. I am delirious.

Your wife's ass is on my mind when I quit your job.

"I quit," I tell your boss. He takes it well.

Your wife has a great ass. An iconic derriere.

---

I am a machine. 

I sit down at the desk. I open the briefcase. I lay out the notes.

"We should do our taxes," your wife says. "We'll file for the return and I'll take you out to dinner."

The sunlight catches the loose strands of her hair. She wears a halo of sunfire.

I run the numbers.

You owe three thousand dollars. Perhaps not the best timing in quitting the day job.  Sacrafices must be made.

Your mundane fears and anxieties do not effect me. I am a machine.  What do I care about your bank statement? What do I care about your wife's state of mind? I am here to disconnect from the conventional trappings of society. To free you from your bonds,  so you can achieve something, so you can write something worth writing.

They hooked you up to a machine. They taped diodes to your body. They flashed images before your eyes. They asked you questions. "What do you see?"

You saw roadkill. You saw rifles aimed at the sky. You saw chains.

They ran tests. They loosened you up, they slipped images into your cognitive gaps and used them to pry your mind loose from its moorings. To prepare you for my arrival.

They played tones in your ears. They asked you questions. "What do you hear?"

You heard tones.

"When you hear two tones that are slightly out of pitch alignment, you hear an oscillating reinforcement pattern. The tones cross-talk, and you get a tremolo effect. A subtle pulsing caused by a dissonant overlap. One of the remarkable things about the brain--about the normal brain--is that it will actually recreate this pulsing tremolo, even when the two tones never meet. If we play a different tone directly into each ear--eliminating any physical phase cancellation from the wave patterns--the brain will recreate *subjectively* the physical phenomena of interference: you should hear the pulsing tremolo in your head, as a pure mental artifact, as the brain combines the two tones into one auditory experience, the interference pattern re-emerges in your perception, if not in the physical world. Every once in a while, we get a rare case like yours, in which the two tone are not reassembled properly, or in the expected manner, I should say. This is common in cases of brain injury especially. The hemispheres become disconnected. They each process data individually, without talking to one another. The right brain and the left brain continue in almost normal operation, but without being aware of what the other is doing. Life goes on, but this can be indicative of other ... potentially problematic psychoses <!--TODO: word for mental conditional afflictions - psychoses? foibles? maladies? --> ... emotional dissociation--a disconnect between a patient's emotional experience and their rational mind. It can be very isolating ..."

A selection of keys hangs in the entrance hall.

One of them opens the door to your dead neighbor's apartment. You know the key by touch. It is bigger than the others. It is freshly cut. It has a large, rounded base. I hold the key in my hand.

I go back to your desk and read the piece you wrote about finding your neighbor dead on his apartment floor.

He was angry with you. For not being able to say no. For not carving out the space in your life to focus on the things that are important to you. For not taking the time to write.

You took care of him. You regret not taking better care of him. You should have known he was going to die. But, there is a difference between the slow, inevitable approach of death and its immediate onset. You know one day you will reach the end of the journey, but the horizon never seems to draw any closer. One day you will die, but that day is not today. That day is never today, until it is. You go about your affairs as if life will go on forever.

Your neighbor's last day was like this.

You took him to the bank. He withdrew three thousand dollars in cash--spending money for the next few months. You brought him home and you left for work. You checked in on him later. He wasn't well. You should have taken him to the hospital, but you didn't.

He struggled to focus, unable to get up from his easy chair. It was a good thing you had the key made, just a few days before. You knocked on the door and called his name. He answered you, his voice weak. He normally would walk over to the door and let you in, but not this time. You had to run upstairs and get the key.

He asked you for a glass of water and an oxycodone. His pills were in the kitchen.

He didn't want to go to the hospital, so you lifted him out of the chair and carried him to his bed.

"I've got to go back to work," you told him. "I'll check on you in a few hours."

That's what set him off.

"What the fuck are you doing?" he said. "How many jobs do you need? You know what your problem is? You can't say no to people."

"I certainly can't say no to you," you said<!--, half joking -->.

"You can't fucking do it." He wanted you to try. To say the word. To feel what it felt like in your mouth. "Say it!" he said.

He pushed and pushed until you shouted at him. "No!" you said. "Fucking No."

Your neighbor collapsed into his bed. "Bring me another pill," he said. "I've got a haircut appointment in the morning. If I'm still feeling like this, I don't know how I am going to make it. I'll have to call a taxi."

You told him to forget about the hair. "It's just going to fall out, anyway," you said. He'd just started chemotherapy.

"It's not about the hair," he said. "It's about the commitment. I have an obligation. I mean to keep it."

This was not the last thing he said to you, though it was close. You checked in on him a few hours later, before you went to work the hotel shift. You brought him a sandwich, in case he was hungry, but he asked you to put it in the fridge. He'd need something to eat later.

This is how your neighbor met his end. Planning for a future that did not exist.

His last words to you were a request for another oxycodone, which you brought to him, along with another glass of water. You put the cordless phone on the bedside table, within easy reach.

The key to his apartment is heavy in my hand.

<!-- [2014-06-16 05:09] -->

The apartment is musty. It smells of old carpet. Your neighbor's cane is hung over the bathroom doorknob. His bed is unmade, as if he had just risen. There is some change and unsorted mail on the sideboard. Dresser drawers contain socks, underclothes, nothing more. A stack of newspapers by his easy chair. Files. Papers. On the table, unread junk mail.

I don't find the money. I come out of his apartment with a roll of stamps and a handful of oxycodone.

## Three 
<!-- STATUS: second draft -->

There is a bookcase on your desk. The bookcase is painted blue. It sits there, crowding out the workspace. It is clogged with notebooks and style guides and volumes of symbolism and mythology and etymology and literary criticism and essays on narrative structure and folklore and poetry.

This is a collection of reference materials selected to give the impression of one dedicated to the craft of writing. The presentation is artificial. It strikes me as something a third-rate set designer would cobble together--it is the hobbyists idea of what a writer's desk should be.

A length of twine is stretched taut between two nails driven into the face of the bookcase. A binder clip on the line holds an image printed on a four-by-six index card. A black Madonna and child. Her face is long, her eyes disproportionately high in her face, leaving her with a small, compressed forehead. She wears a black hooded robe emblazoned with a pattern of fleur de lis. It is hemmed in gold and lined with deep red silk. In the crook of her left arm, the child half-sits, half stands. He is almost floating there. He is not proportioned like a child, instead he looks something like a small man. His robe is hoodless and deep red, a V-neck printed with a repeating pattern of gold sunbursts. He holds a book on his lap, clutching it to his stomach with his left hand. His right hand is raised. At first, I think he is holding on to the hood of his virgin mother's robe, but when I look a little closer, I see that his hand is raised in greeting, the first two fingers pointing up toward the two scratches on his mothers face, or beyond. The third and fourth fingers are tucked away beneath his thumb.

Both mother and child have gold cuffs and perfect round halos.

Your book needs whiskey.

You had a good ride on the wagon, but sacrifices need to be made.

I put the bottle on the desk while I sort through the wreckage of your manuscript.

The protagonist hands a bath house attendant a tarot card as an order token. He steps into a giant tub and hot blue water pours down on him. After the tub fills, he pulls a chain and the bottom drops out. The tub flushes like a toilet, sucking the protagonist down the drain. He struggles to keep above water, but is knocked unconscious. He wakes up in the bathroom of a commuter train. He is on his knees, staring into the blue water of the toilet, which is slick with the rainbow hues of spilled gasoline.

The scene is rewritten three or four times, with various features. He enters a boathouse. A hooded, skeletal figure with eight arms takes a token of salt and blood and leads the protagonist into a small boat. Chain gears engage and the amusement park ride begins. Your protagonist is incrementally overtaken by terror and desire. Hands reach out of the darkness to caress him. He is titillated and terrified.

The anonymous hands tear his clothes from him and push him into the water.

<!-- 2014-03-29 | 16:35:44 -->

Sex and panic grow and he struggles in desperation, clinging to life until he is finally overwhelmed and he lets go and falls into the great release, a complete dissolution of his conscious being-- a climactic orgasm of the relief of death. You describe it as 'the moment when a drowning man ceases to fear or his life and accepts a lungful of water.'

He again wakes in the bathroom of a commuter train, staring at the rainbow film floating on the deep chemical blue of the toilet water.

A third take on the scene describes your protagonist climbing into a coffin-sized canister--a message capsule for a massive pneumatic tube delivery system. He is shot out into the black void of empty space, where he realizes that he is, and always has been, utterly and terribly alone.

He struggles in the confined space, desperately trying to masturbate before he dies. He manages to grip his erection and squeeze it in the palm of his hand, but there isn't enough space in the canister to get an effective rhythm going. He can't complete the task he has set out to.

---

I slip away from the manuscript.

I Google transubstantiation and metempsychosis and ritual and I slide down the slope of Jung and Campbell and Joyce to morality, good and evil, and I am on to Schopenhauer.

My mind turns to efficiency. To the efficient expenditures of time.

Time is everything now. Focus is everything.

I am a machine. I am focused. On target.

I make lists of things to change. Lists of things to stay the same.

<!-- 2014-03-29 | 17:03:35 -->

---

Your habits and tendencies are creeping into me, crawling in through the gaps of exhaustion, forcing their way into my consciousness.

Every time I sit at your desk, I either fall asleep or I drift off into some distraction, some habit of yours. I struggle to stay focused.

I've already quit your day job. This will free up time. This will give me the opportunity to be well rested and alert when I confront the page.

But I need something else. I need to get away from this computer, where your habits and unconscious tendencies are strong. I need a typewriter.

I go back to the computer. I research typewriters. EBay. Etsy. These are my best shots.

---

I find a machine for sale. A West German machine. Distributed in the United States under the name AMC, the machine was manufactured in 1958 by a company called Alpina. It is a marvel of engineering, as far as the typewriter blogs would have it.

I am particularly interested in a photograph from the early sixties that may or may not have been an official Alpina promotional shot. The image features a contortionist in a gold sequined bikini. She is resting her elbows on a thick shag or sheepskin rug, her fingers on the keys of the typewriter in front of her. The contortionists body is twisted up behind her, her back arched--nearly folded in half--so her feet point in the same direction of her hands. Her body appears to be almost rolled into a little ball, with her back on the inside.

If I were behind her, on my knees, I could lean in and bite her vagina. Her little mound--though it is covered by the taught, shimmering fabric--is exposed. The arc of her stretching body lifts it toward heaven.

I consider myself to be an ass enthusiast, but I am intrigued by this inverted presentation of the vulva. There is something about the bend of her body that is reminiscent of an ass. Though the cheeks are not there, her body bends as if they are.

If I were to eat her out from behind, I'd place my hands upon her and spread her wide open so I could pull her sequined panties aside and tickle her twat with my tongue. But my hands would not be on her ass at all. They would be on her hips, on her thighs. I would spread her apart, open her up, and drink of her vulvic nectar without placing my tasting face between her cheeks. Her cannon would not be pointed at me, but at the heavens. At god himself.

<!-- her cannon? -->

The typewriter will arrive at the hotel (shipping to a downtown apartment is unreliable at best) within two weeks.

I am a machine. I am focused. I am uncompromising. I am carving out the space I need. I've quit your job and I've bought a typewriter. Things are looking up.

I tab back to the photograph.

Would I miss it? Would I miss her cheeks pressing in on mine as I kissed her from behind? Maybe. But the novelty of the position would consume me. If I really wanted her ass, I would only have to lean forward a little, reach with my tongue and slip it into her crease as I pull her legs back over my shoulders. I'd be up to my ears in ass.

<!-- 2014-03-30 | 03:59:28 -->

"How's the writing going?" your wife asks.

"Jesus Christ," I say, involuntarily. "I didn't hear you come in. Check it out. I ordered one of these typewriters."

She shrugs out of her unbuttoned shirt and tosses it in the direction of the hamper. As she walks toward me, she drops her bra to the floor. Her breasts are bright and fresh. She has tight, petunia-pink aureoles and pencil eraser nipples.

"Remember Outside Lands?" she says. "I wanted to punch *everyone* in the face that year." She peels off her jeans and leans across your desk to get a better look at the computer screen.

Her panties are printed with the same golden sunburst pattern as the Holy Child's robe. Her hip holds the same graceful curve as the virgin mother's hood. The soft dimple of flesh along her spine leads my gaze to her ass. <!-- Her iconic derriere. -->

"Nice," she says. "I thought you were looking at porn."

"It's typewriter porn."

Explosions of golden sunburst send sparks through my brain.

Your wife lifts the bottle of whiskey from the desk and knocks back a slug. She disappears into the kitchen and returns a few minutes later with a pair of lowball glasses tinkling with ice and glowing with golden liquid.

"I quit my job," I tell her.

Have we been here before? I am on the street, in front of a long billboard, stripping away the layers of old advertisements.

I slide your scraper between Lady Gaga and Rolling Rock and I twist and pull on the handle, forcing it toward me, millimeter by millimeter. The paper stretches and strains until it cracks with the snap of a firecracker. I slam the scraper into the widening gap, smashing the layers apart little by little, blow by blow.

Once I get a handle on it, once a good run is going, the paper tears away from the plywood easily, tearing clean away in long, jagged strips. I tear the larger sheets into smaller sheets and lay them carefully into large black plastic bags, keeping everything neat and flat so they will all fit easily into the trunk of the car.

But of course you know all about this. I am falling into the same trap you fell into--leaving me excessive notes, describing to me all the things I would need to do, as if I would not be aware of them by simple fact of proxy. <!-- the simple facts of proxy and habit? proximity and habit -->

Here were are, addressing each other from either side of the abyss, telling each other things we already know.

The cell phone rings in my pocket. It is your wife. She sounds panicked.

"I'll be done in half an hour," I say. "Can you walk to me here? I'll take you home."

She can. Should take her ten minutes to get here.

Forty minutes later, I call her back. She doesn't know where she is. "Fuck that place." She says into the phone, not quite shouting, not quite crying. "They don't care about me there. They don't give a shit. I ... I changed into my work clothes, and then I threw up. I changed back into my street clothes, but I just sat there, shaking. I was going to walk out. Without saying anything. Just walk out of there. But I threw up, and I put my work clothes back on."

"Where are you?" I say.

"I don't know. Downtown."

I look at a map in a bus stop. I ask her for street names. I tell her which way to go.

"Maybe this is what we need," she says. "A catalyst. A fire under us. We can't keep working these bullshit jobs. We need the motivation to apply ourselves. Fuck this place. Lets get out of this city. Lets leap. We'll build our wings on the way down."

I take her home. She's got a half-empty bottle of whiskey in her purse. She lies down. She's exhausted, she says. "That place is toxic," she says. She wants to be left alone for a while. She wants to sleep. Which is fine. I've got an idea for the book.

Typewriters that talk to the dead.

I give your wife one of the oxycodone pills from your dead neighbor's apartment. "This will help you relax," I say.

I take one of the pills myself and sit down with your notes while your wife lays down in the other room with the television. The soft flickering of screenlight casts shadows through the gap under the door.

I log into your computer and open your text editor. I lay a stack of notecards on the surface of the desk next to the computer and I go to work, tapping out a few notes to get things started. Living typewriters crawl around in the darkness of my head, communicating between one world and the next. They send messages from one side of the abyss to the other, passing messages from the living to the dead, from the dead to the living. They tell each other things they already know.

I write. I get into a rhythm. It goes. The story takes shape. For the first time I see that shape taking form. Like a silhouette against the darkness. I want her. She wants him. He wants me.

"I thought you'd be asleep," I say. Your wife is propped up on pillows, watching television with a glass of whiskey in her hand.

"I can't sleep," she says, slurring her words. "I've been thinking. Not everyone gets it. This thing we have. Honesty is important, isn't it?

I tell her that it is, up to a point. "Honesty is required to make a relationship like this work."

"Up to a point? A relationship like this?"

"You find things out about yourself that you wouldn't find out otherwise. You are confronted with challenges you can't confront on your own. Right? There are blind spots--things about ourselves we will never be able to clearly see, for whatever reason. It takes a partner to act as a mirror. Another person who can see what you can't see, and who can reflect it back to you. It takes honesty and courage to face those things openly. I think that ... if you don't bring those things into a relationship, then there is really no point to it. From a growth perspective. If you aren't able to honestly look at the issues that come up, then what is the point? You might as well be on your own."

"Yeah. But you don't need a relationship for that," I say. "If sex is all you want, why get married?"

"For love ... to share your life with someone. To support each other."

"Sure. And that takes hard work and honesty, doesn't it? A willingness to confront difficulty when it arises. To face the shit you do not want to face."

"But if you are just challenging each other all the time ... that doesn't sound like a lot of fun."

"Sex is fun. Marriage is commitment."

"I've been thinking about what you said. About taking a lover. Maybe we should do it. Take lovers."

"Why not?" I say.

Do you know your wife wants to sleep with other men? How would you react in my place? Would you be angry? Should *I* be angry?

I feel like less of an intruder.

Your poem rings in my ears.

> I am so out of touch with my own emotional experience that I seldom have > an accurate understanding of my own feelings--in fact, I tend to transmute > every stimulus into an expression of sexuality.

"Whatever you want," I say.

I don't know how I feel about this. It excites me. It troubles me. It sets some pinwheel spinning. An unfamiliar feeling begins to stir.

"Great," says your wife, who is my wife too, if only by proxy. "Because I was hanging out with an old friend when I went back home. Nothing happened ... but we've been texting. We used to hook up, years ago. He's got a girlfriend now, but we were texting, and it just sort of came up. He's coming to town on Sunday. We're getting a hotel room."

She rolls over and goes to sleep.

She goes to sleep and I look at her for a while. I don't have anything to say, so I don't say anything.

I get up and go back to the other room. I go back to your desk and try to write.

I can't focus. I am scattered and jumbled. This is not like me. My mind is an uncontrollable mess. It goes places it should not go. It wanders alone, without supervision or control.

I can't write. I lie down, but I can't sleep.

I toss back and forth. I get up. I go back to the desk. I go back to the bedroom and look at your wife. There is an empty bottle of whiskey on the floor next to her. Her back is to me.

I pace the apartment.

I shit. I shower. I shave. Time stands still. I watch the clock. Nothing happens. I brush my teeth. I look into the mirror. I look into your eyes. Nothing happens.

I pace the apartment.

Your wife's phone is on the stand in the hall, plugged into its charger. I know the passcode to her phone, because you know the passcode to her phone.

Is this what she meant by 'honesty?'

'I just came so card for you,' she wrote. The time stamp is a couple of hours old. I was sitting at your desk, writing in your book, while she was sitting in your bed, writing that.

'Tie me up,' she wrote. 'Spank me. I want you to finish in my ass.' There are pictures. 'This is how wet I am for you. Watch me play with my pussy. I want to swallow your cock.'

It goes on and on. She is better at it than he. He writes 'Dude, I wish it were Sunday already.'

I feel a breathless sinking feeling. Disorienting. I am light headed. I sit back at your desk and I crack my knuckles, looking at stacks of papers, reading the spines of your books, looking at the Black Virgin and her Child. They both look sad. Their lips are turned down. Their eyes are lidded and heavy, with dark circles under them.

What is this feeling? Why am I feeling this? I should be relieved. She will be out of the apartment more. I will have time to write. The typewriter will not have arrived by Sunday ... but this affair might go on for some time. Perhaps the distraction will continue for several months. Perhaps this is the beginning of the end.

She isn't quite awake when I shove her face down into the pillow. "You dirty slut," I say.

I rip the blankets aside and sink my palm into the round of her ass with a resounding clap. I peel down her panties, rolling them across the halo of her iconic derriere.

I spread her cheeks apart and press my face into her. I spank her as I tickle her asshole with my tongue. I slide my hands under her hips and life her up so I can lick her clitoris. She is salty and slick.

I tease her with my tongue and slide my fingers inside her. She moans as I enter her, pushing her down, pulling her hair.

When it is over she breathes a quick sigh. "Sorry," she says. "I'm too drunk to come."

She turns away from me and wraps her arms around a pillow.

I get up and go back to your desk. I begin to write. The taste of your wife
lingers on my tongue, and the words drip from my pen. I couldn't stop them
if I tried.
